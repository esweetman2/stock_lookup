# Stock Application
### Intro
Hi! This is an application that gets stock data and charts the data from the last 100 days. You will also be able to simulate buying a stock and building a portfolio. 


# Goals
The goal of this projecst was to better understand the Fetch API and start working with data. I used Stock data because I thought it would be a good place to grab various data points. 

# What I used

I used the ***Alpha Vantage api*** to get stock data. I used ***GSAP*** to perform some animations on the app. I also used ***Chart JS*** to plot all of the data. This is a strictly front end application, so no database was used.
